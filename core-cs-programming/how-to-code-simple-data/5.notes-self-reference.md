# Self Reference (Recursion)  
Self referencing in another word recursion, is a defined function that works with a list of a values in which the function will call itself/ reference itself.

## Recursion  
1. Define a function that operates on the first element of the list
2. If the first element does not satisfy the result of the function, call the function again to operate on the next element of the list.
3. keep calling the function until the element satisfies the result or until it reaches the end of the list.
 
The function references itself on every element of the list until result is satisfied.

### Recursion/Self referencing is used when:
- Working with **abitrary sized** information
- **Arbitrary Sized Info** is a list of various sized (0 -> N) that we do not know ahead of time. 

 
### Well formed self-reference:
- At least one base case / no self-reference (to stop the recursion)
- At least one self reference 
- Requires a well formed type comment during design phrase
- Make sure the basecase works properly and correctly
- Always trust the natural recursions
 
Recursion follows a template:
``` 
function functionName(list):
    if (list is empty)
        return empty
    else 
        perform base case on first element of list.
        then self reference functionName(next element of list)
```

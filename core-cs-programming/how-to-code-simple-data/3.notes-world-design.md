# How to design worlds
Focuses on using HtdD and HtdF as whole to form a world(class), which in turn creates a more complex program.  
 
## Systematic Programing
**Big Bang Mechanism**  
Big bang mechanism belongs to BSL Dr Racket and it is just another meaning for **Class** that consist of attributes and methods.  
 
## Designing Worlds Recipe.
1. Domain Analysis
    - Sketch a program scenarios
    - Identify constant information
    - Identify changing information
    - Identify big bang options
2. Build the actual program
    - Constants (based on 1.2 above)
    - Data definitions using HtDD
    - Functions defintion using HtDF
    - Work through wish list until done

**Part 1: Domain Analysis**  
First exercise was to design an interactive program that controls a cat to walk from left to right of the screen.

# How to Design Data.  
Data Definition design works much like passing a primitive data to a variable in Python, with indication of the type of the data is being used, a template parameter for which this data is used in a fucntion, and small interpretation of the relationship between the name and the data.  
 

Data design is critical in program design as it drive the design of a function. In this section, the goal is:
- Able to use HtDD recipe to design data definitions for atomic data
- Able to identify problem domain information that should be represented as simple atomic data, intervals, enumerations, itemizations and mixed data itemizations.
- Able to use Data Driven Templates recipe to generate templates for functions operating on atomic data.
- Able to use HtDF recipe to design function operating on atomic data.

### *cond Expressions*  
cond is a multi-armed conditional, it can have any number of cases at all the same level. Essentially it is a parallel if statements
**Syntax:**  
```
(cond [<question-expression> <answer-expression>]
      [<question-expression> <answer-expression>]
      [<question-expression> <answer-expression>]
      ...
      [else <answer-expression>])
```
Similar to Python's elif conditions.

### *Data Definitions*  
Data definition is a way to represent a specific information that correlates with a specific data. This clarifies the data being used in a function.

**Examples of Data definition:**  
Traffic Light color is one of the data below:
- 0
- 1
- 2
interpreted as, 0 is red, 1 is yellow and 2 is green.  
 
### Atomic Non-Distinct. (HtDD)  
**HtDD Recipes**
1. A possible structure definition (not until compound data). 
2. A type comment that defines a new type of name and describes how to form data of that type.
3. An interpretation that describes the correspondence between information and data.
4. One or more examples of the data.
5. A templates for a 1 argument function operating on data of this type.
 

**Example problem**
![Excercise 1](https://github.com/khongminhtn/computer-science-studies/blob/main/core-cs-programming/how-to-code-simple-data/images/htdd-question1.png)  

Step 2:  
cityName is String -> tell us the comment and what type of data it contain 
| Comment (Information) | Type (Data) |
| ----------- | ---- |
|Vancouver|"Vancouver"|
|Boston|"Boston"|
 
Step 3:  
interpretation. the name of a city.

Step 4:  
(define CN1 "Boston")
(define CN2 "Vancouver")

Step 5:
```
(define (function-for-city-name cb)
    (...cn))
```
Template rules:
- Atomic non-distinct: String
 
### HtDF X Structure of Data Orthogonality
- HtDF and HtDD recipes are largely orthogonal
- This means that HtDF works the same way for all forms of data
- When a new data is learned, it is imediately possible to design a function that operates on the new data.
 
**Interval**
*Interval data definitions* are used for information that is a number within a certain *range*. The last number of range sometimes can be either inclusive or exclusive.  
 
**Enumeration**
*Enumeration data definition* are used for two or more distinct values.  
 
**Itemization**
*Itemizations* are used for information that has 2 or more categories, at least one is not a distinct value

**Structure of Information Flows Through**
Structure of Data:  
Information => Data => Template => Function/Tests  
 
Identifying the structure of the information is a key step in program design.

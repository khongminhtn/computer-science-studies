# Systematic Program Design
> ‘What do you want to program ?”
> “How do we break the problem ?”

## Design Method:
- Used to with any programming language.
- Manages complexity:
  - Solve 1 problem at a time.
    - Easy to think.
    - Easy to read.
    - Easy to modify.

#### Design Method = From poorly formed -> Well-structured solution

#### Learning goals:
- Using How to Design Function (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate primitive data.
- Read complete function design and identify its different elements.
- Evaluate different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency.
- Evaluate the entire design to observe how well it solves a problem
 
HtDF recipe makes simple problems harder to solve, but makes complex problems easier to solve.  
 
## *HtDF Recipe*
What is HtDF ?  

- The HtDF recipe systematizes the design of a function.  
- Ensures high quality function.
- Well tested
- Makes hard problems easier to solve
  - Breaks problems down to smaller steps
- Makes easy problems a little harder to design

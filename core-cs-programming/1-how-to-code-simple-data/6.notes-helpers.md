# Helpers  
### Learning Goals  
Be able to design functions that use helpers functions for the following reasons:
1. at references to other non-primitive data definitions
2. to form a function composition
3. to handle a knowledge domain shift
4. to operate on artbitrary sized data
 
> A function should be split into function composition when it performs two or more distinct operations on the consumed data 
 
Sketch out a tree of a function's composition to understand which function belong to where.

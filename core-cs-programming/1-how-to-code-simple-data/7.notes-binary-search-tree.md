# Binary Search Tree
### Learning Goals
- Be able to reason informally about the time required to search data.
- Be able to identify problem domain information that should be represented using binary search tree.
- Be abel to check whether a given tree conforms to the binary search tree invariants.
- Be able to use the design recipes to design with binary search trees.
 
Invariant = True over the entire tree  
**Abstract analysis:**  
- Worst case scenario: Last element in list
- Empty case scenario: Element being searched is not in list

# Course Summary  
### Brief overview of my understanding of the course  
Overall I have learned a new simple language called BSL which stands for Beginner Student Language and other programming language concepts such as Data types(Atomic Data, Non-Atomic Data, Interval Data, Itemization Data, Compound Data, Reference to other types and self referential and mutually referential)  
 
I learned how to design data definitions for each of the data types above and how to use the data to then design the function that consumes it. One particular interesting function design was the idea of Recursion where you can perform operation on an unknown sized list of elements. Finally the concept of Binary Search Tree to search for an element within a unknown sized list.

To my understanding of the course in relation to my knowledge in Python:
-   Atomic Data = integers, float and strings
-   Non-atomic Data = Binary and true/false
-   Interval = Range of numbers
-   Enumeration = Set/Tuples contain fixed size and distinct items
-   Itemization = List of fixed size and non distinct items (int/float)
-   Compound Data = Dictionary 
-   Self-Referential = List of unknown size 0-N (empty list, single item list or single item + listOfItems) 
 
Where the function that operates on self-referential data is a function that consumes a list of unknown size. Then test the *empty list* case then *base* case (first item of list) with case of *atleast 2 or more items*.

# computer-science-studies
This repository is  where I keep track of all my studies on subjects of Computer Science that are relevant to software engineering. My primary focus is to become a software engineer so studying only the relevant subject areas and implement them as I learn, is the main reason why I have decided on taking the self learning path, rather than a Bachelor degree. I am able to have control over what I study and at a pace where I am able to put theory acquistion into practical production. It will be a life long study, not only for improvement but also for revision.
